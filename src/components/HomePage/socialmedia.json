My background is in functional and integrative medicine and I merge Eastern and Western practices to empower my clients to embody thriving health. 💪 \n\nI received a Bachelor’s in Psychology from @eckerdlife, a post-bacc pre-med from @columbia, a Bachelor’s in Nursing from @nyuniversity, and a Master’s in Nursing from @univmiami. I am the co-founder of @thelunafast, a virtual holistic fasting program that has helped 1000+ people fast and detox around the world. By combining the LunaFast with psychedelic therapy, kundalini yoga, nutrition, functional integrative medicine, and more, I create a personalized program for my clients to heal at the root and tap into their inner physician! 👩‍⚕️ \n\nFor the past 8 years, I immersed myself in the personal exploration and education of psychedelic medicines. Through facilitating in ayahuasca and psilocybin ceremonies, I saw miracles that couldn’t be explained by Western medicine and was able to deeply heal from past trauma. Since then, I have been on a mission to break the stigma surrounding psychedelics and share this medicine with my community.\n\nCurrently, I serve ketamine therapy & integration for clients at @spinewellnessflv and combine all my expertise and bio-hacking therapies for cellular rejuvenation, mental health optimization, and spiritual awakening. I also co-facilitate and lead global yoga wellness retreats and organize live and online monthly events, workshops, and trainings. \n\nBianca Abbott, MSN, ARNP, FNP-BC\n\n➡️ Interested in starting your healing journey?
